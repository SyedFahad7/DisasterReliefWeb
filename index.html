        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">Natural disasters have devastating impacts on communities worldwide, leaving behind a
            trail of destruction and despair. Lives are shattered, homes are lost, and entire communities are left
            reeling in the aftermath.</p>

                <p class="second-paragraph"> In the wake of such calamities, rebuilding becomes more than just a physical
                    endeavorâ€”it's a testament to human resilience. Communities rally together, drawing strength from
                    solidarity and determination. Volunteers pour in from all corners, offering aid and support to
                    those in need. Amidst the rubble, seeds of hope are sown as people unite to restore what was
                    lost. It's in these moments of adversity that the true spirit of humanity shines brightest,
                    illuminating pathways to recovery and renewal. Despite the scars left by disaster, the unwavering
                    resolve to rebuild emerges as a beacon of hope for a brighter tomorrow.</p>
